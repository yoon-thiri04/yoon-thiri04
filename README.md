- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yoon-thiri04
- ðŸ‘€ I'm particularly interested in collaborating on projects that involve Java, especially J2EE MVC with JSP and Servlets as I continue my journey in learning Spring Framework.
- ðŸŒ± I'm passionate about learning languages, especially in the realm of J2EE development, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the world of technology, particularly in backend development.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Despite being very friendly, I'm not the best at communication.
   I might have a baby face and petite body structure, just a girl who lost in the wide IT field fr,haha.
